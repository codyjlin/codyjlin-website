## Cody's Personal Website

Uses React, Next.js by Vercel, Material Kit by Creative Tim.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in the design process and/or stack I used, and let me know if you have feedback on the website!

## Node.js Version

This repository is configured for Node.js `25.x` (latest release major).

- If you use `nvm`, run `nvm use` in the project root.
- Note: this project uses an older Next.js stack and may require dependency upgrades to run cleanly on the newest Node major.
